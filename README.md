# Codeforces-Practice-Ladders

A python script to suggest which problem to practice, inspired by [A2OJ Ladders](https://a2oj.com/Ladders.html). The code picks up problems in the specified rating range from [Codeforces Educational Rounds](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/21496) held to date and returns the simplest unsolved problem from this range. The output includes the question suggested (name and link) and indicates your current progress on the ladder.

Before running the script, make sure to set your `handle` and adjust the `min_rating` and `max_rating`.

Sample output:
```
Suggested Problem: Pairs
Link: https://codeforces.com/contest/1463/problem/D
Current Progress: 48/138 Questions
```
